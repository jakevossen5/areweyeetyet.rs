    <h1>Are We Yeet Yet? No</h1>

    <h2>What is this page</h2>

    This is a tracking page to see if/when <code>yeet</code> becomes a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/keywords.html">reserved keyword</a> in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a>.
    Note, the goal is to get it as a <em>reserved keyword</em>, not necessarily if it is used in the language.

    <h2>Timeline</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2021-04-17: A <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/3058-try-trait-v2.md#summary">RFC</a> was merged that uses the <code>yeet</code> syntax</li> to avoid weighing in on other keyword options
        <li>2021-03-07: Internal <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/syntax-for-returning-early-with-an-error/14181">form discussion</a> around returning errors early</li>
        <li>2021-02-11: A <a href="https://twitter.com/yaahc_/status/1359886855013994501?s=19">Twitter discussion/poll</a> was created about reserving <code>yeet</code></li>
        <li>2020-04-10: The language team <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/04/10/lang-team-design-meetings.html">discussed</a> adding <code>yeet</code> as a reserved keyword</li>
        <li>2020-04-09: A <a href="https://yaah.dev/try-blocks">blog post</a> suggests using the <code>yeet</code> keyword early returning errors</li>
        <li>2020-04-07: <a href="https://manishearth.github.io">Manish Goregaokar</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ManishEarth/status/1247538296848179200">tweeted</a> about using <code>yeet</code>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ManishEarth/status/1384364056207712260">after coming up with the idea in a conversation</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/yaahc_">Jane Lusby</a></li>
        <li>2014-09-16: The syntatic idea around this type of syntatic sugar is introduced in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0243-trait-based-exception-handling.md#throw-and-throws">this RFC</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What does <code>yeet</code> solve?</h2>

    <p>Rust error handling can be verbose and clunky sometimes. There is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/project-error-handling">a whole team</a> dedicated to making it better.
        One of the goals is to make it easier to propagate errors, so the idea is to add syntactic sugar for <code>return Err(e)</code>.
        This could be <code>throw e</code>, <code>fail e</code>, <code>bail e</code> or any other number of keywords.
        I could talk about how <code>throw</code> exists in other languages, <code>bail</code> is already used in many crates, but fundamentally, languages can be whatever we want them to be.
        Words are not off limits just because they are slang, it is okay to have fun, and as a community we can come together and say <em>yes</em> to <code>yeet</code>.
        <br>
        <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/122651-general/topic/are.20we.20yeet.20yet.3F/near/235007572">Eh2406's Zulip message</a> points out that at some point, "Ok" was considered slang for "Okay", but we have <code>Ok(T)</code>.
        So why not <em>yeet</em> our way into the future and add <code>yeet</code> as a reserved word?
    </p>

    <h2>Will we ever be <code>yeet</code>?</h2>

    <p>No, and it is probably for the best. <code>yeet</code> is just a placeholder term to prevent <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding">bikeshedding</a> and preventing progress on a legitimate feature, not a serious language proposal. And while I have talked extensively about the benefits of reserving it as a keyword on this page, it would prevent <code>yeet</code> being used as an identifier, and <code>yeet</code> is <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/122651-general/topic/are.20we.20yeet.20yet.3F/near/234890876">for the people</a>. So while we are all having fun with <code>yeet</code>, don't expect this page to change.</p>
